## Description

The Task Management Website with CRUD Operations project is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Built using # Next.js for the frontend, # MongoDB as the database, # Node.js for the backend, and styled with # Tailwind CSS, this project showcases a seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies.

CRUD Operations:

Create (C): Users can easily add new tasks to the list, specifying details such as the task name, description, and due date.
Read (R): The application displays the list of tasks, allowing users to view and prioritize their to-dos.
Update (U): Users can edit task details, including the task name, description, and due date, to keep their lists up to date.
Delete (D): Unwanted tasks can be removed from the list with a simple delete operation.
